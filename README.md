# Epoch-IOS
The first ever intelligent operating system: 'Epoch'.
This is the repository for my 'Epoch' project, which is to make an operating system that has AI directly integrated within it.
An OS like this would allow the user complete control of their computer by givng it commands in simple englsih.
The OS could find, create, and download files, optimize hardware settings, program directly into the terminal, and do anything else it needs to to succesfully interpret and execute the user's commands.
