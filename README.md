# Epoch-OS
The Epoch OS project is a development poject dedicated to creating the first ever intelligent operating system which would use AI to both optimize the hardware and interpret and execute user commands.
The main vision of the project is to get an OS that would make users able to tell their computer what to do in plain English (or whatever language you speak) and have it figure it out, rather than the user having to figure out how to tell their computer what to do.
I believe that an OS like this would give its users unlimited control over their devices, without them having to be extremely tech-savvy.
I started this project becasue I was frustrated at how restrictive most modern operating systems are and how the ones that aren't (like Linux), aren't very user-friendly and require that you know a lot about computer science to use them.
It's my dream to make computers things that you work with, rather than through, and unlock the hidden power of our devices for everyone, regardless of their skill in computer science.
